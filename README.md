The research project SEE-KID was carried out over almost 21 years within different organizations.
* University of Applied Sciences, Department of Software-Engineering for Medicine, Hagenberg Upper Austria (1998 - 2002)
* Upper Austrian Research GmbH (2003 - 2007)
* RISC Software GmbH, Research Unit Medical-Informatics (2008 - 2019)

SEE-KID provides a software system SEE++ which implements a biomechanical, interactive 3D simulation of the human eye and its muscles. The SEE++ software can simulate common surgical eye muscle operations (transposition, shortening etc.) in a graphical interactive way that is familiar to an experienced surgeon.

**The SEE++ software is now freely available for download!**

Additionally, the system is used for education and training purposes, because by means of extensive possibilities for parameterization of the human eye model, common pathological cases of human eye motility (e.g. strabismus) can be modeled – and subsequently treated.

The software project SEE++ is the realization of a biomechanical model of the human eye and is partly based on ideas and concepts originally invented and implemented in the software system Orbit™ 1.8 by Joel Miller (Eidactics). This mainly mathematical description of the oculomotor system forms the basis for the proper predictions on simulation and treatment of pathological cases.

The SEE-KID project and the application of the software system SEE++ were supported by grants of the Upper Austrian Local Government, the Hospital of the Barmherzigen Brüder Linz and the Hospital AKH Linz.
